# simple_itunes_list
This is a simple iTunes song list app with bookmark feature

I used tab navigation template created by Android Studio. I made use of coroutine, Retrofit 2 to request and manage data from API endpoint. I used Room Database to handle SQLite database operation for bookmark feature. I added Shimmer for loading screen. I also used Koin for dependency injection.
